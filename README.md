### Project description:

1. (dadi) - Create a simple 'dice' game where the user is asked to input a number between 1 and 6, that number is compared to a randomly generated number between the same values. If the user's number is higher, the user wins. Print the outcome to console.

2. (mail) - Simulate a rudimentary login process. Ask the user to input their email. If the email is found in a pre-populated array, print to console that acces was granted. Otherwise, print to console that access was denied.
